//
// This is a Gradle multi-project build.
// See settings.gradle for the subprojects.
//
// The two subprojects are:
// groovy-hashcode-ast-library - The main library that is packaged as a jar.
// groovy-hashcode-ast-test - Tests using the library.
//
// We do it this way because it's difficult to have AST transformers and
// integration tests in the same project.
//
// Gradle Multi-Project documentation is here:
// https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html
